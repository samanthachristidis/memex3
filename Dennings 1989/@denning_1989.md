Summary

- Dennings discusses the origins of the Arpanet and speculate about its influence. The Arpanet begins in the late 1950s, during the early development of intercontinental ballistic missiles. 
- Paul Baran of the Rand Corporation proposed a distributed network of computers that would have sufficient redundancy, no central control, and could automatically reconfigure its routing information. 
- Baran's reports became public in 1964, and Larry Roberts of mit's Lincoln Labora tory began realizing the potential of networking. In 1965, Donald Davies proposed a computer network using telephone trunk lines and switching computers that could process 10,000 messages per second.
- The Arpanet protocol would be responsible for routing packets across multiple networks, and tcp would reassemble messages with few errors despite the possible loss of packets in the underlying network. Various community networks began to appear around 1980.
- The administration and Congress are planning to expand networking through an organization to be called the National Research and Education Network. Henry Ford would be surprised by the changes in human practices that have grown up around the auto mobile. 
- A technological discourse goes through five major stages: declarations, prototypes, tools, industries, and widespread practices. The passage through these stages is not smooth and regular, but rather a drift affected by many events. 
- Around 1965 the first design proposals were put forth, and by 1970 the first prototypes were operating in the early Arpanet. By 1980 the first industries were emerging. 
- The Arpanet was not built to carry electronic mail, but it became the major source of traffic within two years. Connectivity also emerged unexpectantly as a driving concern, and interruptions in the flow of electronic mail are now considered major disasters. 
- The Arpanet and its derivatives have emerged as an industry in their own right, and the significance of the Arpanet lies not in the networking technology but in the fundamental shifts in human practices that have resulted.
- Dennings notices four major discourses: scientific technology, busi ness, higher education, and government. 
- Scientific technology discourse looks ahead to a high-tech world of scientific research, featuring by the year 2000 supercomputers with 1 to 10 teraflops performance, networks with 1 to 2 gigabits bandwidth, portable computers and smart cards linked by radio to the world network. 
- Higher education emphasizes research over teach ing, places a high value on individual freedom and accomplishment, and disregards skills needed by individuals to work together effectively in organizations. 
- The discourse of government includes concerns for competing in international markets, maintaining the national research lead, and developing a faster manufacturing capability, a desire to be world leader in all areas, and a suspicion of multinational cooperative ventures. 
- Business, science, and government users are concerned about the integrity and privacy of information entrusted to computers and databases. 
- Dennings believes that academic freedom at the universities has produced muted public statements that seem to indicate a lack of willingness to take measures to foster respect for net work security in students. 
- The Arpanet began operation in 1969 as an experiment in resource sharing among computers. It has evolved into a worldwide research network of over 60,000 nodes, influencing the design of other networks in business, education, and government.
