Summary

- In January 1992, Edwards dad brought home a small black plexiglass box labeled "ZOOM" that allowed him to connect to other computers and share data over the dial-up telephone network.
- At the time most BBSes were small hobbyist fiefdoms with a single phone line, and a tin-pot dictator who lorded over anyone who visited.
- Edwards dad then handed off a photocopied list of BBS numbers from our 919 area code in North Carolina, and they started using BBSes.
- Edwards older brother embraced calling BBSes first and filled up his Procomm Plus dialing directory with local favorite BBSes. Each system gained its own flavor from its sysop.
- A BBS was the first place Edwards realized you could download free games to your local computer. He mentions how he remember asking his brother to download Rampage.ZIP, but he declined because it would have taken over five minutes to transfer.
- Edwards states that back then, online time was precious. You didn't want to hog the line for too long or the sysop might kick you out
